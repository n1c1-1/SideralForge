# Logbook of the pilot run

Newest entries at the bottom. Times are local.

## 2026-10-31 evening: start

- Branch `pro-client` created; mockups alt1-alt3 and the GUI spec committed (c13804d).
- docs/pilot/PILOT.md written: goal, plan A-F, rules.
- Phase A launched: three agents, one each for the architecture map, the engine knowledge and the spec from the
  mockup.

## Phase A done
- ARCHITECTURE.md:
  - 17 fixed stages; the cache is keyed by variant name and random run_id, so no sharing between workflows;
  - the ComfyUI blocks already cache by settings hash (pattern to reuse);
  - one run per project; events.jsonl; --until exists;
  - fast tests: 84 passed.
- ENGINE_KNOWLEDGE.md:
  - rules: read-only real projects, nonreg 4 datasets + blind judges, 100 % checks, no patch stacking;
  - the raws of Rosette / Horsehead / Flaming Star / M31-2023 are now only under G:\Astro.
- spec/:
  - SPEC, BLOCKS, POST, ENGINE_CONTRACT;
  - 41 NEW settings, 6 NEW methods / stages;
  - missing in the engine: workflows as options, the settings-keyed store, sessions, Post composition, …
- Next: phase A2, the design of the engine contract and the client (design agent), then dispatch.
